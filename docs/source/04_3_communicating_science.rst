Communicating science 
---------------------

Modern media offers huge opportunities for communicating science to the broadest possible audience.

This is ever more frequently done by scientists themselves as a result of passion for sharing knowledge, and more and more commonly as an explicit requirement of their research activities. Engagement with media offers a number of benefits to the scientific community including:

* Promotion of primary research (i.e. journal articles).
* Acting as role models for future generations and helping to create a feeling of participation and ownership - showing that science is part of society.
* Creating cross disciplinary collaboration between scientists themselves.
* Engagement with journalists who can then accurately tell stories to broader audiences. 

In terms of the Earth Observation sector, for scientists engaging with media, it can help to:
* Show the relevance of data to current news: satellite imagery nearly always has something to add to a news story, whether it’s an aerial view of a big cultural event, or a beautiful environmental phenomena.See EXAMPLES.
* Be human and approachable. Sharing challenges and facets of day-to-day life, can help foster engagement, reducing ‘ivory tower’ feelings around science.
