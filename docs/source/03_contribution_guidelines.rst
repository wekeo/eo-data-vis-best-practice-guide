Contribution guidelines
=======================

This good practice guide is an open community development, licensed under Creative Commons 4.0. We welcome suggested edits and additional content from anyone who would like to contribute.

There are two ways that you can contribute. In both cases you will need to create a `GitHub account <https://github.com/>`_. Once you have done this, you should find your way to the source repository for this documentation, which can be found at `<https://github.com/wekeo/eo-data-vis-best-practice-guide>`_. You can find the documentation itself in the *./docs/source* folder. From this point onwards, how you contribute depends on your level of familiarity with git;

1. If you are a GitHub beginner: you can contribute content by raising an "issue" on the top tab, and add the content you would like to change. We will monitor the issues and merge the changes for you once they have been approved.

2. If you are more familiar with GitHub contributions can be made in the form of merge requests. We will review the content prior to accepting the merge request. For guidance on setting up the repository and making merge requests, please see the `Read the Docs documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html>`_ and general guidance on `use of GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en>`_.

.. note::

You can access the GitHub source code for any *Read the Docs* page by clicking on the small "pencil" icon on the top of each page. You can then edit and submit a pull request. 

Contributors should be careful not to violate the associated terms of the Creative Commons licence, making sure that any material shared (images etc) are permitted to be used in this context, and appropriately attributed. If contributors add new images, they should attribute to themselves and implicitly agree to the resharing of those images under the terms of the license associated with this guide. As far as possible, contributors should seek to work within the currently defined structure of the document, however new sections can be proposed, if they are a significant addition not represented in the current structure. New contributors should add their names to the author list above, with their merge request.

In this guide, we consider what makes a story, told with the use of visualisations of Earth Observation data, impactful. We take a broad interpretation of impactful. Impactful can mean (non exclusively):

* Communicates a challenging topic accurately
* Reaches a large audience, directly, or via multiple platforms
* Reaches an audience that typically does not engage with a topic
* Can be used in an education or training context
* Promotes the application of Earth observation data for societal benefit

This good practice guide covers Earth observation data visualisation in the broadest sense â€“ from single images, through to visualisations created from multiple data products representing complex analysis. This guide also refers to examples beyond computer-based visualisations.

Within the initial workshop, and subsequently within this good practice guide, we have avoided examples relating to human conflict, and in the case of natural disasters, avoid exploiting the event and place a priority on retaining the dignity of those affected.

Contributors should keep the above context in mind when submitting contributions to this good practice guide.

.. note::

If you have any problems at all with contributing, or wish to discuss the good practice guide with us, please contact the EUMETSAT `helpdesk <mailto:ops@eumetsat.int>`_, referencing this webpage and requesting the attention of Hayley Evers-King.
