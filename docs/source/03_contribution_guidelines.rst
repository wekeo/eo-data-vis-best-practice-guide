Contributors should be careful not to violate the associated terms of the Creative Commons licence, making sure that any material shared (images etc) are permitted to be used in this context, and appropriately attributed. If contributors add new images, they should attribute to themselves and implicitly agree to the resharing of those images under the terms of the license associated with this guide. As far as possible, contributors should seek to work within the currently defined structure of the document, however new sections can be proposed, if they are a significant addition not represented in the current structure. New contributors should add their names to the author list above, with their merge request.

In this guide, we consider what makes a story, told with the use of visualisations of Earth Observation data, impactful. We take a broad interpretation of impactful. Impactful can mean (non exclusively):

•   Communicates a challenging topic accurately
•   Reaches a large audience, directly, or via multiple platforms
•   Reaches an audience that typically does not engage with a topic
•   Can be used in an education or training context
•   Promotes the application of EO data for societal benefit

This good practice guide covers EO data visualisation in the broadest sense – from single images, through to visualisations created from multiple data products representing complex analysis. This guide also refers to examples beyond computer-based visualisations.

Within the initial workshop, and subsequently within this good practice guide, we have avoided examples relating to human conflict, and in the case of natural disasters, avoid exploiting the event and place a priority on retaining the dignity of those affected.

Contributors should keep the above context in mind when submitting contributions to this good practice guide.
