How can data providers make storytelling easier?
=================================================

The data visualisation workshop that prompted the first draft of this guide, instigated a lot of discussion about what data providers can do to make storytelling easier for others. Here we have gathered key points related to this topic, to service data providers in future user requirement definition:

To support storytelling, data providers can:

* Provide regular images in timely response to events e.g. `Copernicus image of the day <https://www.copernicus.eu/en/media/image-day?>`_, `EUMETSAT case studies <https://www.eumetsat.int/case-studies>`_.
* Make images reusable: Offer images under open licensing conditions that are clear, and allow for sharing.
* Make images editable: storytellers frequently need to alter images to suit their context. This could mean changing regional and/or temporal focus, it could also mean altering the style (font, colours etc). Data providers can facilitate this by providing platforms that allow for image editing, and/or making code for image generation open source reusable with suitable licence conditions.
* Compile annual reports of important environmental metrics e.g. `European State of the Climate <https://climate.copernicus.eu/ESOTC>`_ and `Ocean State Report <https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/ocean-state-report>`_
* Provide fitness-for-purpose information, so that non-experts can find suitable data sets for different applications.
* Provide expert user support. 
* Support their subject experts in creating an online, personal presence to participate in networking activities related to storytelling.
