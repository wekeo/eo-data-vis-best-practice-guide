Throughout the spring of 2023, and under the umbrella of the Copernicus Programme, EUMETSAT coordinated the production of a series of workshops focussed on effective ways to visualise Earth observation data. This series brought together perspectives and opinions from journalists, scientists and remote sensing practitioners from operational agencies and industry. The series offered advice on how to craft impactful stories using products and imagery derived from satellite records, as well as giving practical examples and demonstrations of data use and access. This document, the Earth observation data visualisation good practice guide, synthesises and summarises the main points of this webonar series, giving examples of effective use of story-telling using satellite data in a variety of contexts.

The guide is by no means a comprehensive overview of all satellite applications, and, given the pace of development in the space sector is unlikely to ever be. It is also not a compendium of all good examples of data visualisation using satellite data, but rather offers representative examples. However, the project is ongoing, and open, and you should feel free to contribute to it should you have opinions to share, examples to add, or constructive criticism to offer. If you wish to access the primary material used to create this guide, you can find links to the presentations on the :ref:`workshop presentation <workshop_presentations>` page, or links to the YouTube videos of the presentations on the :ref:`introduction <introduction>` page.
