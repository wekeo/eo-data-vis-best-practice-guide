Oceans and sea ice visualisations
---------------------------------

Satellite data can reveal underlying physics, beautiful painting-like patterns, and risks to humans (such as those from some types of algal blooms).

Whilst providing information is a core aim of most EO visualisation, artistic and creative approaches can also be inspiring.

Many datasets contain variables offering different perspectives on a domain, and can be presented in different ways to provide a more complete picture of a situation.

Clear labelling, and annotation can help make visualisations much more understandable. Including links to sources can help viewers recognise legitimate data sources.

More and more news sites are providing visualisations via their own dashboards. Comparing multiple data sources can help communicate the reliability of key conclusions in stories told with EO data.

EO data can be supplemented with other data sources towards a wide variety, of societally and environmentally valuable applications.
