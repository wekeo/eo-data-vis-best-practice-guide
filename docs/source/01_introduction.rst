============

Effective visualisation of Earth Observation data is key to its benefit across all sectors of society. It is particularly important when communicating to non-experts, about environmental phenomena and events that impact their day-to-day lives and when communicating to anyone involved in decision making. It is important for accurate communication of scientific results, but can also be used to powerful effect to connect the general public with our planet and the challenges we face to manage our interactives with it, sustainably. 

This good practice guide developed initially from a series of workshops held by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological satellites, in partnership with the European Commissions Copernicus programme. The series of 6 webinars, covered a variety of environmental thematics, and invited contributions from scientists, journalists, and communications experts. Practical demonstrations of EO data access, applications, and visualisation were also given by various personnel working under the Copernicus programme entrusted entities. The presentations can be found on the EUMETSAT Youtube channel (playlist link).
