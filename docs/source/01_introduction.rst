Introduction
============

While satellite imagery and other products have generally been available since the 1980s, the EUâ€™s Copernicus programme has ushered in a new era of freely accessible Earth observation (EO) imagery and data. 

Effective visualisation of Earth observation data is increasingly important to help raise awareness of environmental phenomena, extreme weather events and the impact of climate change. It is also important for accurate communication of scientific results at a time when mis- and disinformation around science and research is becoming more of an issue. 

This good practice guide developed initially from a series of six data visualisation workshops that were funded by the European Commission `Copernicus programme <https://www.copernicus.eu/en>`_ and organised by `EUMETSAT <https://www.eumetsat.int>`_.

The series of six webinars covered a variety of environmental themes and invited contributions from scientists, journalists, and communication experts. 

Practical demonstrations of Earth observation data access, applications, and visualisation were also given by various personnel working under the Copernicus programme entrusted entities. 

The presentations can be found on a designated `playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOQg9n6Apif1BlpT808l8EdgHMndNhNlT>`_ on the `EUMETSAT YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiN59j5b1fAGnXVzIYFpaMw>`_, or you can view the first one, below, and follow the links at the end.

Associated slides from the presentation can be found in the designated workshop `git repository <https://github.com/wekeo/eo-data-visualisation>`_. You can find links to the individual weeks in the :ref:`workshop presentations <workshop_presentations>` section.

This guide is a living resource. We welcome contributions from individuals, journalists and any related initiatives within the Earth observation community.
