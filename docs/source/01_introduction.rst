Introduction
============

Effective visualisation of Earth observation data is key to its benefit across all sectors of society. It is particularly important when communicating to non-experts, about environmental phenomena and events that impact their day-to-day lives and when communicating to anyone involved in decision making. It is important for accurate communication of scientific results, but can also be used to powerful effect to connect the general public with our planet and the challenges we face to manage our interactives with it, sustainably. 

This good practice guide developed initially from a series of workshops held by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), in partnership with the European Commission `Copernicus programme <https://www.copernicus.eu/en>`_. The series of six webinars covered a variety of environmental thematics, and invited contributions from scientists, journalists, and communications experts. Practical demonstrations of Earth observation data access, applications, and visualisation were also given by various personnel working under the Copernicus programme entrusted entities. The presentations can be found on a designated `playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOQg9n6Apif1BlpT808l8EdgHMndNhNlT>`_ on the `EUMETSAT YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiN59j5b1fAGnXVzIYFpaMw>`_, or you can view the first one, below, and follow the links at the end.

Associated slides from the presentation can be found in the designated workshop `git repository <https://github.com/wekeo/eo-data-visualisation>`_. You can find links to the individual weeks in the :ref:`workshop presentations <workshop_presentations>` section.

This guide is a living resource. We welcome contributions from individuals and any related initiatives within the Earth observation community. Please see the :ref:`contribution guidelines <contribution_guidelines>` for information on how to add to this resource.
