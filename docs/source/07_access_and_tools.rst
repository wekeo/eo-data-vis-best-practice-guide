Access to Earth observation data and tools for visualisation
============================================================

A wide variety of ways exist to access and work with EO data for visualisation purposes. Which data access routes and/or visualisation tools an individual chooses will depend on some combination of:

* Whether a suitable visualisation is readily available through an existing service.
* The complexity of the topic (i.e. is a single image enough to illustrate the story, is a series of images needed, or, is more detailed data analysis and visualisation needed)
