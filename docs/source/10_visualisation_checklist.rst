Visualisation Checklist - 10 points to consider 
=================================================
Key points to think about when storytelling with Earth observation data

1. Have you made sure that your image/animation is **simple and easy to understand**. If you can, test it with others before releasing it.

2. Does your image have a simple key, scale bar, and where relevant a background map, so that people understand the context and everything is clear in the image or animation?

3. Try to use a colour scheme that is clear and **appropriate for the data shown**. 

4. Have you annotated the main features that you want to show e.g., wildfire, donâ€™t assume that it will be obvious to everyone.

5. If you have labels on your image, try to **keep text to a minimum** and **avoid jargon** or specialised technical terms.

6. Can you include additional supporting information, where possible, to back up your image/animation?

7. If possible can you provide links, for instance, links to scenes in online Earth observation data viewers, so that others can recreate your image.

8. Have you made sure that your image/animation will **work with all mobile formats** for social media channels?

9. If it is a single image, would it be better to animate a series of images to make the focus more easy to see and understand?

10. Where possible, try to blend different types of Earth observation data, e.g., infrared or SAR data, as well as true colour imagery if it will help to highlight the focus of your image or animation.
