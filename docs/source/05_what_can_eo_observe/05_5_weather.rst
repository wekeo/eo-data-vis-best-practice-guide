Weather

The story of Earth observation really begins with weather. 

The impact that weather has on our day-to-day lives makes it both a natural priority for satellite measurements, but also for storytelling. 

Satellite measurements, such as humidity and temperature, play an essential role in numerical weather prediction for the provision of forecasts at daily and seasonal scales and to issue warnings of extreme weather. 

Data from satellites can also provide excellent visual context for reporting on weather events, showing the scale of impacts of storms, fog, rain and snow, and other phenomena. 

New satellites such as EUMETSAT's `MTG-I1 <https://www.eumetsat.int/meteosat-third-generation>`_ can also provide information on lightning.

For example visualisations, with discussions, see the :ref:`climate and weather visualisations<climate-weather>` section.
