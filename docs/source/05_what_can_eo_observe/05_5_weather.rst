The story of Earth Observation really begins with weather. The impact that weather has on our day-to-day lives makes it both a natural priority for satellite measurements, but also for storytelling. Satellite data plays an essential role in numerical weather prediction for the provision of forecasts at  daily and seasonal scales. Satellite data can provide excellent visual context for reporting on weather events, showing the scale of impacts of storms, fog, rain and snow, and other phenomena. Newest satellites can also provide information on lightning.
