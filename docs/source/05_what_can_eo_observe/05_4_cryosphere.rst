Cryosphere
----------

A variety of Earth Observation measurement techniques are employed to observe the Earths icy environments. Data from SAR and radiometric instruments can be used to observe ice and its characteristics both on land and sea. Sea ice presents challenges for marine navigation and safety, with observations of floating ice key to many operational oceanographic services in polar regions. Changes in ice, both on land and sea are also a key part of the story of climate change, with both event scale changes (e.g. large iceberg calving and ice sheet collapse) and seasonal trends of interest.

For example visualisations, with discussions, see the :ref:`oceans and sea ice visualisations<oceans-sea-ice>` section.
