What can Earth observation observe?
===================================

Modern Earth Observation by satellites provides measurements that can support our understanding of nearly all aspects of the Earth system. From topics affecting land, to oceans, our atmosphere to ice, short term weather, and long term climate; satellite data has something to say about the status of the parts of our planet upon which we depend. 

Active and passive remote sensing techniques provide numerous ways to observe these systems. A huge array of products is available, at various temporal and spatial scales. Selecting the right product can be a challenge, however support is offered by data providers through guiding documentation, example case studies, tools, and expert user support.

A full breakdown of Earth Observation measurement techniques and applications is beyond the scope of this document, but the subsections below summarise some key application domains covered by this data, with relevant cross-over indicated.
