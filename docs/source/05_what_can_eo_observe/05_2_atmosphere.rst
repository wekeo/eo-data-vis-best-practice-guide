Atmosphere
----------

Satellite measurements of the atmosphere can tell us about the way it moves and what it is composed of. This provides important information towards understanding weather and climate, but also for a wide variety of topics including air quality, impacts of dust, greenhouse gas and volcanic emissions, and wildfires.

For example visualisations, with discussions, see the :ref:`air quality and wildfires visualisations<air-quality-wildfires>` section.

For access to Copernicus atmosphere data please visit the `Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service <https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/>`_.
