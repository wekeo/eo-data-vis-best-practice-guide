Climate
-------

The topic of climate covers long term variability and changes in many aspects of the Earth system. 

Satellite data records are constantly growing, providing time series of measurements of many essential climate variables. From sea-level rise, to ice melting, heatwaves on land and sea, drought and flooding, and extreme weather events; a growing array of climate data records can provide the necessary long-term context for climate related stories. 

For example visualisations, with discussions, see the :ref:`climate and weather visualisations<climate-weather>` section.

To access Copernicus climate data please visit the `Copernicus Climate Change Service <https://climate.copernicus.eu/>`_. EUMETSAT also has long time series of `satellite observations <https://www.eumetsat.int/what-we-monitor/climate>`_ dating back to 1978.
