Satellites can measure key physical aspects of land such as movement (via Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)) and temperature (via radiometry). 

These can variably be used to understand the impacts of earthquakes, landslides, shoreline erosion, as well as effects of weather and climate on land temperature and soil moisture. 

Land use can also be monitored effectively using satellite data, showing changes to buildings, cultivated land, and natural environments (due to deforestation for example). 

Optical imagers can capture significant events happening on land, such as issues affecting infrastructure (roads, bridges, ports, canals etc). 

Thermal hotspots can identify fires, as well activities on land such gas flares and solar farms.

For example visualisations, with discussions, see the :ref:`air quality and wildfires visualisations<air-quality-wildfires>` section.
