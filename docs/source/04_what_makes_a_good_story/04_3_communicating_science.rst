Communicating science 
---------------------

Modern media offers huge opportunities for science communication to very broad audiences.

The role of communicating science is increasingly being taken on by scientists due to their passion for sharing knowledge and also as an explicit requirement of their research activities. 

Scientists can cmmunicate through blogs and articles or social media posts, or through the mainstream media. 

This can bring a number of benefits including:

* Promotion of research (i.e. journal articles).
* Establishment of scientists as role models for future generations and helping to create a feeling of participation and ownership - showing that science is part of society.
* It is important to have active and credible scientific voices on environmental and climate issues against a background of rising misinformation. 
* Creating cross disciplinary collaboration between scientists themselves.
* Engagement with journalists who can then accurately tell stories to broader audiences. 

In terms of the Earth Observation sector, for scientists engaging with media, it can help to:
* Show the relevance of data to current news: satellite imagery nearly always has something to add to a news story, whether it’s an aerial view of a big cultural event, or a beautiful environmental phenomena.See EXAMPLES.
* Be human and approachable. Sharing challenges and facets of day-to-day life, can help foster engagement, reducing ‘ivory tower’ feelings around science.
