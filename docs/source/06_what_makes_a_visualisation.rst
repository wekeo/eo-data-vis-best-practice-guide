What makes a visualisation…?
============================

Whilst EO data is more available than ever, there are challenges to accessing it, using it, and most importantly in the context here – visualising it. Regardless of the particular topic, we can summarise some major aspects to consider about what makes a successful visualisation. 

…clear and understandable?
--------------------------

It perhaps goes without saying that any visualisation should be clear and legible i.e. produced at a high resolution with any text large enough for reading, however further elements of legibility can be underestimated, particularly when visuals are used in different contexts. 
Beyond text, other labelling can make images more clear and understandable. Features of interest can be directly labelled, clearly indicating what a readers’ attention is being drawn to. Features in an image that may be obvious to an EO expert, or even someone familiar with the story in question, but they may not be to someone without this background and/or someone seeing an image for the first time.

Given how infrequently people view the Earth from space with their own eyes, it can be easy to lose the sense of scale. This is particularly true for images where there are no recognisable features. In these cases, a scale bar can be a helpful addition for clarity. Scale can also be important when creating visualisations with numerical data. In these instances, it can be helpful to provide context as part of the visualisation (See an example of this in the relative size of ice loss vs cities below (Figure REF)).

Modern media consumption takes place through a variety of formats – print, but also increasingly through digital media on a variety of screened devices. For visuals to be clear and understandable, they increasingly need to be so in the context of multiple formats and sizes, in particular on screened devices such as mobile phones.

Further practical aspects bear consideration. Colour schemes can be used to great effect to highlight features in EO data, however they need to be suitable for common visual impairment i.e. colour blindness. Colour schemes can also be more or less intuitive, depending on the particular feature of interest e.g. using red for hot and blue for cold is understandable for most people. However, colour schemes can also affect the accuracy of visualisation (see below).

…accurate?
----------

Whilst visualisation must be compelling to be impactful, it must also be accurate in order to have the type of impact which is desired.

For example when telling a story about change, visualisations must represent that change in context. This is particularly important when we are talking about changes in the context of climate. Whilst before and after images are often attention grabbing, care must be taken these are appropriate in the individual context. Are those changes ‘normal’ relative to well understood seasonal or interannual trends? Or are they truly unusual and/or extreme. Excellent visualisations in these topics often contextualise data from the current time period, against data from a longer time period.  Risk is also a related and challenging concept for visualisation, where appropriate context must be given to inform readers about how likely something is to have happened and/or happen again in future.

Attributing cause is a further challenge. Whilst we can address the long-term context of events via use of appropriate long-term records, it can still be challenging to truly say, and then accurately visualise *why* something has/is happening. 

Collaboration with experts can help assure that visualisations are using the most suitable data for the story in development, and provide necessary context and caveats that can be added.

Further tips for making accurate visualisations include use of labels to provide scale and location information, and the selection of colour scales that show true changes using linear change and contrast in the colours selected. 


Whilst visualisation must be compelling to be impactful, it must also be accurate in order for that impact to be that which is desired by those of us who value science communication.

…draw attention?
---------------

The goal of most story telling is to gain attention in some form, even when delivering a specific message to a specific audience. In general, stories and associated visualisations that draw attention are:
* Connected to things that people understand, are concerned about, or are in the current news cycle.
* Unusual, rare, extraordinary.
* Community orientated - e.g. involve networking and recognise community contributions. Images are more likely to be shared when others are recognised for their contributions e.g. tagging data producers, or software developers on social media posts.
