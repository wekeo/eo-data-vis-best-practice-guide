â€¦draw attention?
---------------

The goal of most story telling is to gain attention in some form, even when delivering a specific message to a specific audience. In general, stories and associated visualisations that draw attention are:
* Connected to things that people understand, are concerned about, or are in the current news cycle.
* Unusual, rare, extraordinary.
* Community orientated - e.g. involve networking and recognise community contributions. Images are more likely to be shared when others are recognised for their contributions e.g. tagging data producers, or software developers on social media posts.
