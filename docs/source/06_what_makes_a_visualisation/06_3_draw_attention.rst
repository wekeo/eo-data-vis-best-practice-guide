â€¦draw attention?
----------------

The goal of most story-telling is to gain attention and communicate information to specific audiences. 

In general, stories and associated visualisations that draw attention are:

* Topical in that they provide more information about current environmental issues, weather extremes, etc.  

* Connected to things that people understand or are concerned about.

* Unusual, rare and/or extraordinary.

* Community oriented - e.g. involve networking and recognise community contributions. Images are more likely to be shared when others are recognised for their contributions e.g. tagging data producers, or software developers on social media posts.
