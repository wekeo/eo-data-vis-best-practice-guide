Summary reports
---------------

Some of the Copernicus services author annual reports summarising, for example, the state of the ocean or European climate. These reports often include excellent examples of data visualition and are worth consiering if you wish to create similar ones. IPCC Assessment and Special Reports can also offer similar inspiration.
