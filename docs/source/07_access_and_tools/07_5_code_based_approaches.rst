Thematic code based approaches
------------------------------
Developing your own code can be time consuming, but offers the most flexible way of working Earth observation data and opens up a near-unlimited range of options for visualisation. R, and in particular Python, are two of the most commonly used open-source languages for geospatial work, and there are a large number of libraries that support working with satellite data in both cases. Both R and Python are supported by Project Jupyter, allowing them to be used to construct Jupyter Notebooks which facilitate training on using code. The landscape of available code options is ever changing, and publishing a comprehensive list of them here will be immediately out of date. However, we can recommend some start points.

* If you are working with EUMETSAT data you will find all of our Python based training code on our `EUMETLAB GitLab group <https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab>`_. This contains a number of repositories containing Jupyter Notebooks showing how to work with our marine and atmospheric composition data.
* A similar catalogue of Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the `WEkEO Copernicus DIAS <https://www.wekeo.eu/>`_ catalog
* Jupyter Books on `dust <https://dust.trainhub.eumetsat.int/docs/index.html>`_, `aerosol <https://dust.trainhub.eumetsat.int/docs/index.html>`_ and `fire <https://fire.trainhub.eumetsat.int/docs/index.html>`_ detection can be found on the EUMETSAT TrainHub portal.
* The `SatPy python package <https://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ offers extensive options for data visualisation for those working with weather satellites.
