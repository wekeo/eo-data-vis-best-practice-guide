Thematic code based approaches
------------------------------
Developing your own code can be time consuming, but offers the most flexible way of working Earth observation data and opens up a near-unlimited range of options for visualisation. `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_, and Python are two of the most commonly used open-source languages for geospatial work, and there are a large number of libraries that support working with satellite data in both cases. 

Both R and Python are supported by Project Jupyter, allowing them to be used to construct `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ which facilitate training on using code. The landscape of available code options is ever changing, and publishing a comprehensive list of them here will be immediately out of date. 

However, we can recommend some start points.

* If you are working with EUMETSAT data you will find all of our Python based training code on our `EUMETLAB GitLab group <https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/eumetlab>`_. This contains a number of repositories containing Jupyter Notebooks showing how to work with our marine and atmospheric composition data.
* A similar catalogue of Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the `WEkEO Copernicus DIAS <https://www.wekeo.eu/>`_ catalog
* Jupyter Notebooks on `dust <https://dust.trainhub.eumetsat.int/docs/index.html>`_, `aerosol <https://dust.trainhub.eumetsat.int/docs/index.html>`_ and `fire <https://fire.trainhub.eumetsat.int/docs/index.html>`_ detection can be found on the EUMETSAT TrainHub portal.
* The `SatPy python package <https://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ offers extensive options for data visualisation for those working with weather satellites.
* `Radiant Earth <https://mlhub.earth/>`_ provide Jupyter Notebooks and training data to help you work with Earth observation data and machine learning techniques. 

There are also a variety of cloud based infrastructures that can support you in connecting code to data.

* The `Copernicus WEkEO Data and Information Access System (DIAS) <https://www.wekeo.eu/>`_ cloud platform offers a free Jupyter Hub that you can use to develop cloud-based code to exploit many Copernicus data records, including those from the Sentinel satellite series. It also offers a scalable cloud infrastructure for more advanced data processing.
* `Google Earth Engine <https://earthengine.google.com/>`_ can be used to explore a wide catalogue of free and open satellite data, particularly when the application is focussed on land applications.
