Viewers
-------
Viewers are online platforms that show spatial maps or imagery based on underlying data sets. In general, these maps are based on pre-generated layers and do not show the data itself (e.g. in the case of a Web Mapping Service or WMS).

Many viewers extend their capability to offer either analysis tools to interrogate/manipulate the data, or links to the primary data itself.
