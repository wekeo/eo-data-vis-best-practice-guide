Viewers
-------
Viewers are online platforms that show spatial maps or imagery based on underlying data sets.

In general, these maps are based on pre-generated layers and do not show the data itself (e.g. in the case of a Web Mapping Service or WMS). 

Many viewers extend their capability to offer either analysis tools to interrogate/manipulate the data, or to customise visualisations. Many also offer links to the primary data itself, allowing you to "quick view" a phenomena, and then retrieve the underlying data for bespoke customisation using your own tools.
