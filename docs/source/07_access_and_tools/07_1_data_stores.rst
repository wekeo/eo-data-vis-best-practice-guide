Data stores
-----------
Data stores provide access to the primary data. The nature of the data depends on the provider. 

Though not always the case, satellite operators typically provide data at level-1b and level-2, and downstream service providers supplying data at level-3 and level-4. 

Many providers offer ancillary view and analysis services along side their data stores, but full customisation of the data usually requires download and manipulation with :ref:`software packages<software-packages>` or :ref:`code based approaches<code-based-approaches>`.

**Examples of data stores**

* `Copernicus Marine Services (CMEMS) Data Store <https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/products>`_
* `Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Services (CAMS) Data Store <https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/data>`_
* `Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) Data Store <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home>`_
* `Copernicus Land Monitoring Services Data Store <https://land.copernicus.eu>`_
* `WEKEO Data Viewer <https://www.wekeo.eu/data>`_
* `EUMETSAT Data Store <https://data.eumetsat.int>`_
