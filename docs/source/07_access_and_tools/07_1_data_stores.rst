Data stores
-----------
Data stores provide access to the primary data. The nature of the data depends on the provider. Though not always the case, satellite operators typically provide data at level-1b and level-2, and downstream service providers supplying data at level-3 and level-4. Many providers offer ancillary view and analysis services along side their data stores, but full customisation of the data usually requires download and manipulation with :ref:`software packages<software-packages>` or :ref:`code based approaches<code-based-approaches>`.
