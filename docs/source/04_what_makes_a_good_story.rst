What makes a good environmental story for modern news media?
============================================================

The world is more connected than ever, with media platforms ranging from television, newspapers, and radio, through to online websites, video streaming services, and social media. Those producing content for media range from professional journalists and communication experts, through to scientific experts, and everyday members of the public.

With this diversity of platforms and voices, the opportunities for telling stories about the planet, using Earth Observation data are numerous. However, different platforms, audiences, and communication styles, can require quite different approaches, if stories are to have impact.

Journalists perspectives on environmental stories 
-------------------------------------------------

Environmental stories featuring Earth observation data are appearing more and more on media platforms, produced by professional journalists. Since the early days of the first satellites and moon missions, images of the Earth, of ‘home’ have captured the interest of the public. Modern Earth observation offers the opportunity for the public to be amazed by things they have never seen, to observe extremes, to be connected to distant places on a daily basis. Modern media is not intimidated by the use of EO data - with data timeseries, radar, and thermal data being used in stories, not just classic visible optical imagery. 

This scope of Earth observation data, has resulted in a diverse array of stories able to be told by journalists. 

Human interest stories, where Earth observation data is able to illustrate the scale and extent of impacts of environmental phenomena are, of course, popular. Floods, storms, fires, and earthquakes are more and more frequently being illustrated with satellite imagery. Frequently this data is also used directly in these contexts to protect lives and livelihoods, though this is not always included in the media stories. 

Further examples have told stories about things that are novel, such as new sensor technology.  Similarly, there is a lot of interest in unusual events or observations such as particularly large volcanic eruptions and icebergs. Another related aspect that is appealing in the media,is change. Earth observation data can be used to provide before and after data associated to rapid changes e.g. in glaciers or lakes, or as a result of human actions. Whilst appealing these stories are approached by thorough journalists with caution, to ensure that change is communicated in appropriate context. 

Examples of some of these stories can be found in the :ref:`example stories <example-stories>` section of this good practice guide, and recommendations on what makes a good Earth observation data visualisation for journalists can be found in the :ref:`What makes a visualisation..? <what-makes-a-visualisation>` section.

Telling stories on social media 
-------------------------------

With the availability of social media, the opportunity has arisen for almost anyone to tell stories to almost anyone else. A variety of platforms exist, offering different formats to share data visualisations including images, videos, and text of varying length and style. The virality of social media has great potential to extend the reach of stories told there, however story telling through these platforms often comes with challenges. 

Social media can be used to spread misinformation, and visualisation can be taken out of context. As such the need to be clear and accurate with visualisations is ever more important. 

Many forms of visualisation can be successful on social media, including those which are more interpretive, or fun, can be effective to simply raise awareness of the EO sector and the data it can provide. EO data offers incredible opportunities for creativity, and sharing awe and wonder. 

Social media also allows networking in support of storytelling. Journalists can use social networks to find experts to support visualisations and provide expert perspectives on environmental phenomena.

Communicating science 
---------------------

* Associate with papers
* Bring imagery to day to day activities (field work, locations people know)
* Link with current news articles not including satellite data
* Be human - thing’s don’t necessarily need to be polished to be impactful 
* Be open and visible to connect with different media platforms
