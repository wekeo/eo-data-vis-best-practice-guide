What makes a good environmental story for modern news media?
============================================================

The world is more connected than ever, with media platforms ranging from television, newspapers, and radio, through to online websites, video streaming services, and social media. Those producing content for media range from professional journalists and communication experts, through to scientific experts, and everyday members of the public.

With this diversity of platforms and voices, the opportunities for telling stories about the planet, using Earth Observation data are numerous. However, different platforms, audiences, and communication styles, can require quite different approaches, if stories are to have impact.

Modern Earth observation offers the opportunity for the public to be amazed by things they have never seen, to observe extremes, to be connected to distant places on a daily basis.
