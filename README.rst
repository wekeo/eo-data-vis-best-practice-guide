Welcome to the Earth Observation Data Visualisation series. This repository will act as a place to collect examples of Earth observation data visualisation generated and/or shown throughout the webinars. It will continue to grow and evolve as the webinar series proceeds and will eventually also host the source material for our "best practice guide".
